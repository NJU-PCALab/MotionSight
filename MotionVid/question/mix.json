    "Describe the primary object's specific action, including its fine-grained motion. How does the camera's movement (e.g., tracking, zoom, pan) follow or frame this object's action, and what are the object's key visual attributes highlighted by this interplay?",
    "Considering the primary object's movement and its interaction with other elements, what is its implied goal? How does the camera's perspective (e.g., close-up, wide shot, point-of-view) and any dynamic changes in its movement contribute to or obscure this implied intention?",
    "Analyze a significant change in the primary object's motion or behavior. How does the camera's operation (e.g., a sudden zoom, a switch to slow motion, a change in focus) coincide with and emphasize this specific change in the object's action?",
    "Discuss the overall pattern of the primary object's movement throughout a key segment of the video. Correlate this with the dominant camera movement strategy used in that segment. How does this combined object-camera choreography affect the scene's narrative or the information conveyed about the object's activity?"
